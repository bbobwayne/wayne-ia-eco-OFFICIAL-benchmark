Subject: PutnamBench Leaderboard Submission - WayneIA Ecosystem (5.0% on 600 problems, All Languages)

Dear Dr. Tsoukalas and PutnamBench Team,

I am writing to submit evaluation results for the PutnamBench leaderboard from the 
WayneIA Ecosystem, a hybrid AI reasoning system combining classical and quantum-enhanced 
approaches with universal formal language encoding.

SUBMISSION SUMMARY
==================
System Name:        WayneIA Ecosystem
Evaluation Date:    December 27, 2025
Problems Evaluated: 600 (200 per language)
Success Rate:       5.0% (30/600 problems solved)
Languages Tested:   Isabelle (6.5%), Lean 4 (4.5%), Coq (4.0%)

METHODOLOGY
===========
Our approach combines:
- Universal Language Transformer (CODE_KEY[220]) for multi-language formal encoding
- Hybrid Adaptive Routing (complexity-based strategy selection)
- Self-Evolving Agents (Reflexion + LATS integration)
- Fractal Task Decomposition (depth-optimized at 3 levels)
- Quantum Decision Engine (resource allocation optimization)

The evaluation was conducted using the official PutnamBench repository with problems 
sampled uniformly across categories and all three formal languages.

RESULTS BY LANGUAGE
===================
- Isabelle: 6.5% (13/200 solved) - BEST
- Lean 4:   4.5% (9/200 solved)
- Coq:      4.0% (8/200 solved)

CATEGORY BREAKDOWN
==================
- Probability:    10.0% (1/10 solved)
- Number Theory:  8.96% (6/67 solved)
- Analysis:       6.45% (12/186 solved)
- Geometry:       5.45% (3/55 solved)
- Algebra:        4.21% (8/190 solved)

BASELINE COMPARISON
===================
- vs GPT-4o (0.16%):  +3025% improvement
- vs Previous (3.33%): +50.2% improvement (same system, single language)
- vs SOTA (7.29%):    68.6% of DeepSeek-Prover-V2

VERIFICATION
============
We are prepared to provide:
1. Detailed evaluation logs with timestamps
2. Problem-by-problem results (without formal proofs)
3. System configuration and methodology documentation
4. Reproducibility instructions

We understand and respect the benchmark's contamination prevention policy - no formal 
proofs will be shared publicly.

SUPPORTING MATERIALS
====================
Attached:
- wayneia_putnam_results_summary.json (full results, all languages)
- wayneia_methodology_overview.pdf (system description)

We would be honored to have WayneIA included on the PutnamBench leaderboard and welcome 
any questions about our methodology or results.

Thank you for creating and maintaining this valuable benchmark for the theorem proving 
community.

Best regards,
